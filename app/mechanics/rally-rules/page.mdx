# Rally Rules & Mechanics

Understanding rally mechanics is critical for maximising damage and minimising troop losses. Here are the key principles to follow for Kingshot rallies.

## Starters vs Joiners

- **Rally leaders (starters):** All three of their heroes' skills apply to the rally. Choose heroes that boost rally size and damage. For Bear/Terrors, leaders should be **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus** with **Diana/Jabel** for capacity. For PvP rallies, prefer **Diana / Quinn** to balance attack and defence.
- **Rally joiners:** Only the **slot‑1 hero's top‑right skill** applies. Always put **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus / Amane** in slot 1 for Bear/Terrors. For PvP, use heroes that boost your troop type (e.g. Diana, Quinn).

## Myth vs Fact

- ❌ **Myth:** Four random joiner heroes apply their bonuses to a rally.
- ✅ **Fact:** Only the **slot‑1 hero's top‑right skill** from each joiner applies. Filling other hero slots doesn't matter.

## Attack vs Lethality

- **Attack** increases your damage output. It's useful in PvP and general rallies.
- **Lethality** reduces the enemy's effective HP. For PvE bosses like Bear and Terrors, Lethality scaling is far more important than raw attack — which is why Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus are so strong.

## Quick Rules for Alliance

- **Leaders:** Choose heroes with the right buffs for the event (Lethality for PvE; balanced attack/defence for PvP; HP/Defence for defensive rallies).
- **Joiners:** Slot 1 hero = **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus / Amane**; if you don't have them, send no hero.
- **Fill rallies fully**; don't send half marches. Use 10/10/80 mix if possible.

**Remember:** Joiners contribute only slot‑1 top‑right skill; leaders contribute all their heroes' skills. Use Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus for Bear/Terrors; Diana/Quinn for PvP; Gordon/Howard for defence.

⚔️ Rally Reminder: Leaders apply all hero skills; joiners only apply slot‑1 top‑right skill. For PvE bosses: slot‑1 Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus/Amane. If you don't have them → send no hero. Fill rallies fully; no solos.
