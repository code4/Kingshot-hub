# Chenko

Chenko is widely regarded as the **must‑have hero** for Bear Hunt and other PvE bosses because her kit revolves around **Lethality**, the stat that has the biggest impact on boss damage.

## Why She's S‑Tier for Bear and Terrors

- **Leader:** As a rally leader, all of Chenko's skills apply, giving the rally massive Lethality scaling. Pair her with capacity heroes like Diana or Jabel.
- **Joiner:** Only the slot‑1 hero's top‑right skill applies for joiners. Chenko's top skill adds a stacking Lethality buff, making her the best joiner hero — if everyone uses Chenko in slot 1, the rally damage skyrockets.

## Recommended Pairings

- **Leaders:** Chenko + Diana (or Jabel) for rally size. In PvP rallies, you might swap Chenko out for Diana/Quinn.
- **Joiners:** Chenko works best alongside other Lethality heroes like **Yeonwoo** and **Amadeus**, or the more accessible **Amane**.

## Quick Alliance Line

"Join with **Chenko slot‑1** (or Yeonwoo/Amadeus). Wrong hero lowers rally damage for everyone."
