🐻 **Bear Hunt Tonight – 23:00 UTC**

Closest cities = rally leaders. Leaders use Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus + Diana/Jabel. Joiners slot‑1 Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus/Amane (or no hero). Aim for 10 % INF / 10 % CAV / 80 % ARCH if possible. Check infirmary space. Fill rallies fast!
```

## Vikings Prep Notice

```
🪓 **Viking Vengeance Starting Soon**

Split troops into 4 squads. Buddy up with 4–5 people and reinforce each other. Don't heal during the event. Burn once → extinguish, burn twice → you're out. Infantry‑heavy reinforcements with Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus/Amane in slot 1. HQ waves are 10 & 20; assigned defenders only.
```

## Fertile Lands Move Notice

```
🌾 **Moving to Fertile Lands**

We're expanding banners into Fertile! Please use alliance teleport to move next to the leader. Don't miss out on T8+ resource tiles, faster gathering, and prestige buffs. More members inside = bigger bonuses for everyone.
```

## Rally Reminder (General)

```
⚔️ **Rally Reminder**

Leaders apply all hero skills; joiners only apply slot‑1 top‑right skill. For PvE bosses: slot‑1 Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus/Amane. If you don't have them → send no hero. Fill rallies fully; no solos.
```

## Terror Rally Notice

```
👹 **Terror Rally Alert**

Rally Terrors instead of soloing. Leaders use Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus, joiners slot‑1 Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus/Amane. Check stamina and infirmary space before rallying – stamina isn't refunded and troops get injured on fails. Don't forget to heal after the kill.
