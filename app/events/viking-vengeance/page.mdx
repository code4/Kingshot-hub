# Viking Vengeance

Earn points by defending each other from **20 waves** of NPC Vikings. Coordinate with your buddies, reinforce at the right times, and never heal mid‑event.

## Setup

- **Split your troops into 4 squads**. Example: 120k troops → four marches of 30k each.  These should go to different allies.
- Form **groups of 4–5 players** – you'll reinforce each other throughout the event.

## Event Rules

- **Do not heal** during the event! Healing brings your own troops back to your city and steals kills from reinforcements.
- **First burn:** Put out fires via **Extinguish** in the Guard Station and keep going.
- **Second burn:** Your city is out – you won't get targeted again. You can still reinforce others.

## Reinforcement Tips

- Send **infantry-heavy reinforcements**; they soak damage and maximise kills for points.
- Slot‑1 hero = **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus / Amane** – their buffs boost reinforcement damage. If you don't have them, send no hero.
- If you're **offline** during Vikings, empty your city so friends can reinforce you. Don't send reinforcements yourself – you can't adjust them mid-event.

## HQ Waves

- **Wave 10 and Wave 20** target your Alliance HQ. Assign specific defenders to recall their best march and hold the HQ.
