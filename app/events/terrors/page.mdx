# Terrors (PvE Boss)

**Terrors** are roaming bosses on the map that alliances can rally for rewards. Similar to Bear Hunt but smaller scale, you still want to maximise damage and avoid needless troop losses.

## Rally or Solo?

- **Always rally** if possible. Solo hits waste stamina and risk troop losses. 10 stamina for marches, 25 for rallies.
- Only solo low‑level Terrors when you're sure you can defeat them without heavy losses.

## Hero Setup

- **Rally leaders:** Use **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus** to maximise **Lethality**. Add **Diana/Jabel** for rally capacity.
- **Joiners:** Slot‑1 hero = **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus / Amane**; otherwise no hero. Only the slot‑1 top‑right skill applies to the rally.

## Troop Mix & Stamina

- Ideal mix is similar to Bear: **10 % Infantry / 10 % Cavalry / 80 % Archers**. Send what you have; full rallies matter more.
- Stamina is **not refunded** on failed attacks. Make sure you have enough stamina and infirmary space before starting a rally.

## Injuries & Rewards

- If a rally fails, **both leader and joiners** have their troops **injured** (sent to infirmary).  Injuries count towards your infirmary space; if full, you'll lose troops permanently.
- You still get **partial rewards** based on the damage you dealt – including resources, speedups, and shards.

**Quick tips:** Rally Terrors instead of solo; use Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus as leaders; joiners slot‑1 the same heroes or send no hero; check stamina and infirmary space before rallying.
