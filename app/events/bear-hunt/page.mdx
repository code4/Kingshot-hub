# Bear Hunt (PvE)

**Goal:** Max damage per rally. Closest cities to the pit lead. Full rallies > perfect ratios.

## Rally Leaders (Starters)

- **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus** – Rally leaders: their full kit applies, providing huge **Lethality** buffs for damage.
- **Diana / Jabel** – Secondary heroes to expand rally size.

## Joiners

- **Only the slot‑1 hero's top‑right skill applies** for joiners. Always put **Chenko / Yeonwoo / Amadeus / Amane** in slot 1.
- If you don't have one of these heroes, **leave slot 1 empty** (better than the wrong hero).

## Troop Mix

- Ideal: **10 % Infantry / 10 % Cavalry / 80 % Archers**. Archers deal the most damage vs. Bear.
- Don't worry if you can't match this – send what you have. It's more important to **fill rallies fully and quickly**.

## Timing & Strategy

1. **Start with the closest leaders** to the pit. They open 5‑minute rallies first.
2. **Stagger rally launches** – keep at least one rally marching at all times. When one is half way, the next leader launches.
3. **Final push** – when Bear HP is low, concentrate on the fastest marching leader so it doesn't despawn.

**Alliance Ping:** Bear Hunt at **23:00 UTC** – rally leaders use Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus. Joiners slot‑1 Chenko/Yeonwoo/Amadeus/Amane (or no hero). Aim for 10/10/80 troop mix if possible.
